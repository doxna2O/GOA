            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The <b>Moon landing</b> was the arrival of a spacecraft on the Moon's surface, and it was first accomplished by the United States Apollo 11 mission on July 20, 1969.</p>
            <p>It was a significant achievement in human history and marked the culmination of the Space Race between the United States and the Soviet Union.</p>
            <p>Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first humans to set foot on the Moon, while Michael Collins orbited above in the command module.</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            In 1969 Apollo 11 was the first crewed mission to land on the Moon.[4] There were six crewed landings between 1969 and 1972, and numerous uncrewed landings. All crewed missions to the Moon were conducted by the Apollo program, with the last departing the lunar surface in December 1972. After Luna 24 in 1976 there were no soft landings on the Moon until Chang'e 3 in 2013. All soft landings took place on the near side of the Moon until January 2019, when Chang'e 4 made the first landing on the far side of the Moon.[5]

        <section id="mission">
            <h2>Mission</h2>
            <p>The Apollo 11 mission was launched by a Saturn V rocket from Kennedy Space Center on Merritt Island, Florida, on July 16, 1969. Four days later, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed on the Moon's surface in the lunar module named Eagle.</p>
            <p>Neil Armstrong famously uttered the words, "That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind," as he stepped onto the lunar surface.</p>
            <p>The mission achieved its primary objective of landing safely on the Moon and returning to Earth, fulfilling President Kennedy's challenge.</p>
            <p>During their time on the Moon, Armstrong and Aldrin conducted scientific experiments, collected lunar samples, and planted the American flag.</p>

            <h2>Legacy</h2>
            <p>The Moon landing had a profound impact on science, technology, and society. It demonstrated the capabilities of human space exploration and sparked interest in further exploration of space.</p>
            <p>Following Apollo 11, several more missions were launched to the Moon, including Apollo 12, which landed nearby the Apollo 11 site, and subsequent Apollo missions that expanded our understanding of the Moon's geology and surface.</p>
            <p>The legacy of the Moon landing continues to inspire future generations of scientists, engineers, and explorers to push the boundaries of space exploration.</p>
